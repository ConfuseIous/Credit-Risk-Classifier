# Credit-Risk-Classifier

## This is a classifer for a smaller version of the [German Credit Risk Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/german-credit).

### This model prioritises recall, as it works under the assumption that banks would operate defensively - minimising losses would be their primary goal.
